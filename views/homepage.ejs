		    <li>It allows you to compare genetic information from different services.  For instance, if
		        you have carrier testing from Ancestry.com and you are interested in having a baby with someone
		        who has been genotyped by 23andMe, Well Baby Baby will find the places where the tests

		  There are two notable cases where you may want a
		  another genome scan done: in the case of an organ transplant, and 
		  in the case you develop cancer.
		  Cancer tumors have a slightly different genome than the person
		  who has them, and sequencing the tumor genome will reveal what
		  gene(s) are different and can suggest which sorts of therapies
		  will be effective in treating the tumor.  Similarly, a donated
		  organ such as a kidney or liver will have a different genome 
		  and will have its own drug response and so on.  It is possible
		  to need three scans if you have one done for yourself, develop a
		  tumor that needs to be sequenced then receive a donated organ
		  to replace the cancerous one.  We hope none of our users have 
		  this befall them, but if it does, Well Baby Baby will support
		  multiple genetic profiles for you seamlessly.
